# Rule-Based Chatbot System
This project is a rule-based chatbot system in Python, focusing on clean control flow, reusable class design, and keyword-driven response logic.

## Overview
The chatbot processes user input using keyword matching and predefined response rules.
The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing multiple chatbot personalities to share the same underlying logic while exhibiting different behaviors.

## Key Features
- Keyword-based input parsing and response selection
- Fallback responses for unmatched input
- Multiple chatbot personalities with shared core logic
- Clean, reusable class-based architecture

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented a reusable 'ChatBot' class for handling input processing and responses
- Separated chatbot behavior from control logic for easier extension
- Designed a clear execution flow to manage conversation state

## Tech Stack
- Python

## How to Run
Download ChatBot.py, Chatter.py, good_responses.csv, and evil_responses.csv, and place the files into the PyCharm project.
Run Chatter.py to interact with the chatbot as demonstrated in README.txt. Try having a conversation with the ChatBot!

You can also open responses.csv files to see which keywords trigger specific responses and how the ChatBot reacts to different user inputs.
