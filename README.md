# Rule-Based Chatbot System
This project is a rule-based chatbot system in Python, focusing on clean control flow, reusable class design, and keyword-driven response logic.

## Overview
The chatbot processes user input using keyword matching and predefined response rules.
The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing multiple chatbot personalities to share the same underlying logic while exhibiting different behaviors.

## Key Features
- Keyword-based input parsing and response selection
- Fallback responses for unmatched input
- Multiple chatbot personalities with shared core logic
- Clean, reusable class-based architecture

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented a reusable 'ChatBot' class for handling input processing and responses
- Separated chatbot behavior from control logic for easier extension
- Designed clear execution flow to manage conversation state

## Tech Stack
- Python

## How to Run
Download the ChatBot.py, Chatter.py, and README.txt files and place them in a PyCharm project. Then, run Chatter.py to start the chatbot.
